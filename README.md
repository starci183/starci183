# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Stacy Nguyen â€” Crypto Founder

Iâ€™ve always loved **mathematics** â€” the logic, structure, and problem-solving behind it. That passion naturally led me into the world of **crypto**, where math meets innovation.

As I began building in Web3, I came to realize something essential:

> **Technology alone isnâ€™t enough â€” understanding business is just as important.**

Now, I focus on creating crypto projects that are not only **technically sound**, but also **strategically designed** for real-world impact.

That said, Iâ€™m still deeply rooted in **technology**. For us, success means making **both** â€” code and business â€” **great**.
