# 👋 Hi there, I'm Stacy Nguyen — Crypto Founder

I’ve always loved **mathematics** — the logic, structure, and problem-solving behind it. That passion naturally led me into the world of **crypto**, where math meets innovation.

As I began building in Web3, I came to realize something essential:

> **Technology alone isn’t enough — understanding business is just as important.**

But I haven’t lost sight of what brought me here: **cutting-edge technology**.

I care deeply about:
- ⚙️ Building systems that scale as users grow
- 🔒 Ensuring strong security from day one
- 🧼 Writing clean, high-quality, maintainable code

Now, I focus on creating crypto projects that are not only **technically sound**, but also **strategically designed** for real-world impact.

Because in the end, real success means making **both** — the **code** and the **business** — truly great.
